This project is basen on creating an algorithm, that takes an HTML page as input and infers if the page contains the information about cancer tumor board or not.  Tumor Board is a consilium of doctors (usually from diferent disciplines) discussing cancer cases in their departments.

After completing this project, we will answer some questions. 

Those are:
How did you decide to handle this amount of data?
How did you decide to do feature engineering?
How did you decide which models to try (if you decide to train any models)?
How did you perform validation of your model?
What metrics did you measure?
How do you expect your model to perform on test data (in terms of your metrics)?
How fast will your algorithm perform and how could you improve its performance if you would have more time?
How do you think you would be able to improve your algorithm if you would have more data?
What potential issues do you see with your algorithm?
